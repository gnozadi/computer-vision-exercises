# Computer Vision Exercises

This repository contains a series of Computer Vision exercises across four main topics: image fundamentals, contrast adjustment, frequency and wavelet domain processing, and color space with feature detection. Each exercise is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, and each homework folder includes a detailed README with instructions, requirements, and descriptions for each task.

## Overview

The goal of these exercises is to practice essential image processing techniques across different domains. Each homework assignment focuses on a specific aspect, from fundamental manipulations to more advanced transformations and feature detection methods.

## Folder Structure

- **HW1**: Image Fundamentals  
  Covers quantization, interpolation, and point processing techniques, working on tasks like reducing image bit depth and adjusting brightness and contrast.

- **HW2**: Contrast Adjustment and Filtering  
  Focuses on histogram equalization, noise addition, and filtering techniques, including experiments with salt-and-pepper and Gaussian noise.

- **HW3**: Frequency and Wavelet Domain Processing  
  Involves Fourier transforms, frequency domain filtering, and wavelet decompositions, working with tasks such as DFT visualization and multi-level wavelet analysis.

- **HW4**: Color Space Conversion and Feature Detection  
  Explores color space transformations, color quantization, and feature detection using Harris Corner and SIFT/SURF, with tasks such as converting color spaces and performing image stitching.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x** and **Jupyter Notebook**
- Core Python libraries, including NumPy and Matplotlib
- OpenCV (required for HW4, specifically for SIFT/SURF feature detection)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gnozadi/computer-vision-exercises.git
   ```
2. Install any required dependencies as listed in each folder's README.
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Navigate to the desired homework folder and open the corresponding notebook to explore and run the exercises.

Each homework folder is self-contained, with specific instructions, code, and outputs for each task.
